# 🎼 Beethoven AI: Final Symphony  

A groundbreaking project merging Beethoven’s timeless genius with modern AI technology to redefine symphonic composition.

## 🚀 Core Innovations  

1. **Expressive Nuance: Computer Vision (CV)**  
   - Analyzes Beethoven’s manuscripts and digital scores.  
   - Captures phrasing, dynamics, and thematic development.  

2. **Dynamic Collaboration: Game Theory**  
   - Real-time AI–human co-creation framework.  
   - Balances AI-generated ideas with composer decisions.  

3. **Stylistic Authenticity: Machine Learning**  
   - Deep learning models trained on Beethoven’s repertoire.  
   - Preserves harmonic, rhythmic, and structural integrity.  

4. **Precision & Scalability: RPA Orchestration**  
   - Automates part preparation, rehearsal scheduling, and orchestration logistics.  

5. **Mathematical Depth: Algorithmic Rhythms**  
   - Recursive algorithms + OOP for rhythmic innovation (syncopation, counterpoint, metric modulation).
